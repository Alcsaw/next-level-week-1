## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Celebrate](https://github.com/arb/celebrate)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)

## Next Level Week - Booster

Next Level Week is a micro bootcamp promoted by Rocketseat to teach fullstack development with Javascript/Typescript - Node.js on the back end, ReactJS on the front end and React Native for mobile - in a hands-on experience, by creating a fully functional application with web and mobile front-ends. One single programming language to dominate the entire development cycle, using technologies seen in many of the big companies today.


During the Next Level Week, Rocketseat provides 5 online classes - 1 each day from Monday to Friday - teaching how to build an app from scratch and finishing with an MVP. In this edition of the event we developed Ecoleta.

## Ecoleta

Ecoelta is a marketplace that allows companies to share their waste production items so interested buyers can find and contact the company.


For example, ACME Corp. may product eletronic waste, so it will create a profile and share this information alongside their contact info so when someone searches for eletronic waste on the region ACME Copr is located, he/she will find the company on the map.

## üîñ Layout

The app design was made by Rocketseat using [Figma](https://figma.com).

You can se the project mockup in [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/9TlOcj6l7D05fZhU12xWT3/Ecoleta-(Booster)).
